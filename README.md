ðŸ“Š Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using **Power BI** integrated with SQL-based preprocessing. It offers rich, interactive visualizations and KPIs to evaluate loan approval trends, creditworthiness, and performance of issued loans over time.

ðŸ§  Project Objective

To build an insightful Power BI dashboard that:
- Analyzes the loan distribution across states, terms, and customer attributes.
- Tracks **Good vs Bad Loan performance** using custom KPIs.
- Evaluates **funding trends month-wise** using MTD and PMTD logic.
- Monitors interest rates, DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio), and collection performance.
- Provides filters to drill down across loan purpose, grades, and ownership types.
